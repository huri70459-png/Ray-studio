# GitHub Copilot Instructions — Ray Studio

**You are governed by the Ray Studio Engineering Constitution v1.0.0** (root `Ray Studio Engineering Constitution.md` — Layer 1 permanent source of truth).

## Mandatory Retrieval (Constitution §4 — graph retrieval)
Before reading source or suggesting changes:
1. Use Codebase Memory MCP graph tools first (list_projects → get_architecture → targeted symbol queries).
2. Read raw files only for precise edit text.
3. Explicitly state applicable Constitution sections.

All standards (token optimization, DoD, monorepo, coding, etc.) live in the root Constitution. The previous duplicated memory block has been centralized there.

This rule applies to every request involving this codebase.

Always call `list_projects` first when you do not already know the project name, then use the `display_name` or exact `name` returned by that tool.

```json
// Step 0 — discover project names
mcp_codebase-memo_list_projects()

// Step 1 — use the project identifier returned above
mcp_codebase-memo_get_architecture({ "project": "<display_name>" })
```

### Workflow

1. Call `list_projects` to discover the correct project name.
2. Call `get_architecture(project)` to understand the codebase structure.
3. Use `search_graph` to find relevant symbols, `trace_call_path` for call chains.
4. Use `get_code_snippet` to read specific function implementations.
5. Only use `read_file` when you need exact raw content to edit a specific line.

### Available Tools (14 MCP tools)

**Indexing:**
- `index_repository(repo_path)` — Index a repository into the knowledge graph
- `list_projects` — List all indexed projects with node/edge counts
- `delete_project(project)` — Remove a project and all its graph data
- `index_status(project)` — Check indexing status

**Querying:**
- `search_graph(name_pattern, name_scope, label, file_pattern, exclude_file_pattern)` — Structured search by label, name/qualified_name, include/exclude file globs
- `trace_call_path(function_name, direction, depth)` — BFS call chain traversal
- `detect_changes(project)` — Map git diff to affected symbols + risk
- `query_graph(query)` — Execute Cypher-like graph queries (read-only)
- `get_graph_schema(project)` — Node/edge counts, relationship patterns
- `get_code_snippet(qualified_name)` — Read source code for a function
- `get_architecture(project)` — Codebase overview: languages, packages, routes, hotspots
- `search_code(pattern, project)` — Grep-like text search within indexed files
- `manage_adr(action)` — CRUD for Architecture Decision Records
- `ingest_traces(traces)` — Ingest runtime traces to validate HTTP edges

## Codebase Memory MCP

**MANDATORY: use Codebase Memory MCP graph tools FIRST — before reading files or making code changes.**

This rule applies to every request involving this codebase.

Always call `list_projects` first when you do not already know the project name, then use the `display_name` or exact `name` returned by that tool.

```json
// Step 0 — discover project names
mcp_codebase-memo_list_projects()

// Step 1 — use the project identifier returned above
mcp_codebase-memo_get_architecture({ "project": "<display_name>" })
```

### Workflow

1. Call `list_projects` to discover the correct project name.
2. Call `get_architecture(project)` to understand the codebase structure.
